Additional notes based upon Swift's original species description and upon our observations of the type culture:
Colonies on Czapek's solution agar growing somewhat restrictedly, consisting of a velvety aerial felt more or Iess buckled, pale yellow throughout, often developing a slight green tinge at extreme center, later becoming sulphur yellow in the center with pale yellow to orange droplets; reverse at first dark and indefinite, later becoming green at colony edge, Both perithecia and conidial structures produced but often in limited numbers.
Colonies on malt extract agar spreading, about 5 cm. in diameter in 2 weeks at room temperature, plane, fairly thin, consisting of a fairly loose aerial felt of somewhat funiculose hyphae in which are embedded abundant perithecia near the agar surface and upon which are borne scattered to fairly numerous conidial structures, mostly monoverticillate, occasionally biverticillate and symmetrical.
Colonies on cornmeal agar spreading, showing little aerial growth except around the very pale yellowish perithecia which dot the surface of the colony after a few days; mycelium almost entirely submerged and hyaline; reverse and substrate in certain areas become bright to deep green; conidial structures fairly abundant, produced on trailing hyphae or ropes of hyphae chiefly near the perithecia.
As reported and illustrated by Swift (fig. 153), conidiophores are short, and are usually borne at right angles to the main hyphae; conidiophore walls sometimes show a slight roughening. Penicilli are variable, Sterigmata occur usually in simple verticils of five or six. They are typically acuminate to lanceolate, hence characteristic of the Biverticillata-Symmetrica section of the genus. A single side branch frequently occurs, suggesting a biverticillate condition, or two, three, or rarely more shorter branches may form a true verticil of metulae and constitute a definitely biverticillate penicillus. The conidia are unique among the Penicillin, They are rod-like in form, 3 to 6 µm","Penicillium bacillisporum_26767","Ascospores","6","6",NA,NA,6,6

Characteristics in culture: Colonies on PSA 15-35 mm diam after 14 d at 20 C. Aerial mycelium floccose, white or honey-colored, becoming dark purple. In some strains, aerial mycelium sparse or absent, colonies slimy. Colony reverse-pigmented dark vinaceous to vinaceous, in some cases unpigmented or with unpigmented sectors. Abundant slimy sporodochia formed on the agar surface and in the aerial mycelium; sporodochia buff, pale violet or dark purple, often forming in concentric rings. In some strains fertile ascocarps developing, especially at the colony margins of mature cultures.

Characteristics in culture: Colonies on PSA 15-35 mm diam after 14 d at 20 C. Aerial mycelium floccose, white or honey-colored, becoming dark purple. In some strains, aerial mycelium sparse or absent, colonies slimy. Colony reverse-pigmented dark vinaceous to vinaceous, in some cases unpigmented or with unpigmented sectors. Abundant slimy sporodochia formed on the agar surface and in the aerial mycelium; sporodochia buff, pale violet or dark purple, often forming in concentric rings. In some strains fertile ascocarps developing, especially at the colony margins of mature cultures. On SNA or SNAY hyphal growth diffuse and spreading through the agar, unpigmented, with scattered buff sporodochia forming on the agar surface.

Ripening of the ascocarp, or perithecium, apparently follows the course reported by Dodge (1933). Perithecia were described as at first consisting of ""a solid mass of .pseudoparenchymatous tissue with little or no differentiation except for the somewhat thicker walls of the cells of the outer layer."" The ascogenous system occupied a central position and gradually increased by disorganization of the surrounding tissue. In old perithecia the entire body, with the exception of a comparatively thin outer wall, was composed of mature asci. The fruit body was reported not to be hard and stone-like at any stage although some structures more definitely sclerotioid than most were encountered. In certain cultures, asci were visible in 7 days and ascospores were matured within 10 days after the cultures were planted; in other cultures the process was more delayed. Ascospores were reported as finely echinulate but no mention was made of an equatorial band or furrow, nor was such shown in his illustrations. Ascospores germinated usually by splitting, with the spore walls remaining in two fragments as in definite bi-valve types. Emmons (1935) figured the ascospore with a faint suggestion of an equatorial furrow. In our experience such a line or furrow is sometimes evident although usually lacking.
The conidial apparatus in NRRL 710 remains typical of the species. The penicilli are typically monoverticillate but not infrequently show branched structures as originally illustrated. Sterigmata consistently show the narrow conidium-bearing tip described by Dodge. Conidia are definitely elliptical and agree satisfactorily with his original measurements (fig. 39C and D).
Although the species was shown to be homothallic by both Dodge (1933) and Emmons (1935), most strains of Penicillium brefeldianum in continued artificial culture show a marked tendency to develop sectors that are predominantly conidial. Even by exercising special care as to areas from which recultivations are made, it is often extremely difficult to maintain a strain which produces abundant and normally maturing perithecia. Strains freshly isolated from nature generally produce quantities of perithecia, but often lose this capacity in large measure after relatively few transfers. The type, NRRL 710, is an example. Other strains maintained in this laboratory for more than a decade show no evidence of developing asci, although there remains some suggestion of perithecial initials. A strain received from the Centraalbureau in February 1946, as Carpenteles biefeldianum (Dodge) Shear, undoubtedly ascosporic when first isolated and diagnosed by them, produces small rounded masses of heavy-walled cells but shows no evidence of ascospore development.

Although the species was shown to be homothallic by both Dodge (1933) and Emmons (1935), most strains of Penicillium brefeldianum in continued artificial culture show a marked tendency to develop sectors that are predominantly conidial. Even by exercising special care as to areas from which recultivations are made, it is often extremely difficult to maintain a strain which produces abundant and normally maturing perithecia. Strains freshly isolated from nature generally produce quantities of perithecia, but often lose this capacity in large measure after relatively few transfers. The type, NRRL 710, is an example. Other strains maintained in this laboratory for more than a decade show no evidence of developing asci, although there remains some suggestion of perithecial initials. A strain received from the Centraalbureau in February 1946, as Carpenteles biefeldianum (Dodge) Shear, undoubtedly ascosporic when first isolated and diagnosed by them, produces small rounded masses of heavy-walled cells but shows no evidence of ascospore development.
A number of strains believed to represent Penicillium brefeldianum Dodge have been examined in our current study. One of these, NRRL 2083, received in November 1946, from Wm. I. Illman, University of Toronto, apparently duplicates the original type almost exactly.

"ascospores within two weeks. The ascospores agree closely with the species description in form and dimensions (fig. 39F), and in comparative mounts are indistinguishable from the few still produced by the type, NRRL 710. The conidial apparatus likewise duplicates Dodge's original figures and description. Since Dodge did not include detailed colony descriptions in his diagnosis, these are presented for NRRL 2083:
Colonies on Czapek's solution agar attaining a diameter of 3 to 4 cm. in two weeks, radially furrowed with central area commonly raised, consisting of a comparatively thin basal felt with surface loosely floccose (fig. 39A), mostly in white to light yellow shades, usually light sporing, conidial structures borne largely from the aerial mycelium, commonly not affecting the colony appearance but sometimes abundantly produced in localized sectors; perithecia numerous, often developing after ten clays to two weeks, usually in a layer adjacent to the agar surface, commonly obscured by the overlying vegetative growth, occasionally appearing massed in sectors predominantly perithecial, spherical to oblong, from 100 to 200 µm","Penicillium brefeldianum_9799","ascospores","200","200",NA,NA,200,200

Additional notes based upon Swift's original species description and upon our observations of the type culture:
Colonies on Czapek's solution agar growing somewhat restrictedly, consisting of a velvety aerial felt more or Iess buckled, pale yellow throughout, often developing a slight green tinge at extreme center, later becoming sulphur yellow in the center with pale yellow to orange droplets; reverse at first dark and indefinite, later becoming green at colony edge, Both perithecia and conidial structures produced but often in limited numbers.
Colonies on malt extract agar spreading, about 5 cm. in diameter in 2 weeks at room temperature, plane, fairly thin, consisting of a fairly loose aerial felt of somewhat funiculose hyphae in which are embedded abundant perithecia near the agar surface and upon which are borne scattered to fairly numerous conidial structures, mostly monoverticillate, occasionally biverticillate and symmetrical.
Colonies on cornmeal agar spreading, showing little aerial growth except around the very pale yellowish perithecia which dot the surface of the colony after a few days; mycelium almost entirely submerged and hyaline; reverse and substrate in certain areas become bright to deep green; conidial structures fairly abundant, produced on trailing hyphae or ropes of hyphae chiefly near the perithecia.
As reported and illustrated by Swift (fig. 153), conidiophores are short, and are usually borne at right angles to the main hyphae; conidiophore walls sometimes show a slight roughening. Penicilli are variable, Sterigmata occur usually in simple verticils of five or six. They are typically acuminate to lanceolate, hence characteristic of the Biverticillata-Symmetrica section of the genus. A single side branch frequently occurs, suggesting a biverticillate condition, or two, three, or rarely more shorter branches may form a true verticil of metulae and constitute a definitely biverticillate penicillus.

Ripening of the ascocarp, or perithecium, apparently follows the course reported by Dodge (1933). Perithecia were described as at first consisting of ""a solid mass of .pseudoparenchymatous tissue with little or no differentiation except for the somewhat thicker walls of the cells of the outer layer."" The ascogenous system occupied a central position and gradually increased by disorganization of the surrounding tissue. In old perithecia the entire body, with the exception of a comparatively thin outer wall, was composed of mature asci. The fruit body was reported not to be hard and stone-like at any stage although some structures more definitely sclerotioid than most were encountered. In certain cultures, asci were visible in 7 days and ascospores were matured within 10 days after the cultures were planted; in other cultures the process was more delayed. Ascospores were reported as finely echinulate but no mention was made of an equatorial band or furrow, nor was such shown in his illustrations. Ascospores germinated usually by splitting, with the spore walls remaining in two fragments as in definite bi-valve types. Emmons (1935) figured the ascospore with a faint suggestion of an equatorial furrow. In our experience such a line or furrow is sometimes evident although usually lacking.
The conidial apparatus in NRRL 710 remains typical of the species. The penicilli are typically monoverticillate but not infrequently show branched structures as originally illustrated. Sterigmata consistently show the narrow conidium-bearing tip described by Dodge. Conidia are definitely elliptical and agree satisfactorily with his original measurements (fig. 39C and D).
Although the species was shown to be homothallic by both Dodge (1933) and Emmons (1935), most strains of Penicillium brefeldianum in continued artificial culture show a marked tendency to develop sectors that are predominantly conidial. Even by exercising special care as to areas from which recultivations are made, it is often extremely difficult to maintain a strain which produces abundant and normally maturing perithecia. Strains freshly isolated from nature generally produce quantities of perithecia, but often lose this capacity in large measure after relatively few transfers. The type, NRRL 710, is an example. Other strains maintained in this laboratory for more than a decade show no evidence of developing asci, although there remains some suggestion of perithecial initials. A strain received from the Centraalbureau in February 1946, as Carpenteles biefeldianum (Dodge) Shear, undoubtedly ascosporic when first isolated and diagnosed by them, produces small rounded masses of heavy-walled cells but shows no evidence of ascospore development.
A number of strains believed to represent Penicillium brefeldianum Dodge have been examined in our current study. One of these, NRRL 2083, received in November 1946, from Wm. I. Illman, University of Toronto, apparently duplicates the original type almost exactly.

A strain received from the Centraalbureau in February 1946, as Carpenteles biefeldianum (Dodge) Shear, undoubtedly ascosporic when first isolated and diagnosed by them, produces small rounded masses of heavy-walled cells but shows no evidence of ascospore development.
A number of strains believed to represent Penicillium brefeldianum Dodge have been examined in our current study. One of these, NRRL 2083, received in November 1946, from Wm. I. Illman, University of Toronto, apparently duplicates the original type almost exactly.

"Ascospores were reported as finely echinulate but no mention was made of an equatorial band or furrow, nor was such shown in his illustrations. Ascospores germinated usually by splitting, with the spore walls remaining in two fragments as in definite bi-valve types. Emmons (1935) figured the ascospore with a faint suggestion of an equatorial furrow. In our experience such a line or furrow is sometimes evident although usually lacking.
The conidial apparatus in NRRL 710 remains typical of the species. The penicilli are typically monoverticillate but not infrequently show branched structures as originally illustrated. Sterigmata consistently show the narrow conidium-bearing tip described by Dodge. Conidia are definitely elliptical and agree satisfactorily with his original measurements (fig. 39C and D).
Although the species was shown to be homothallic by both Dodge (1933) and Emmons (1935), most strains of Penicillium brefeldianum in continued artificial culture show a marked tendency to develop sectors that are predominantly conidial. Even by exercising special care as to areas from which recultivations are made, it is often extremely difficult to maintain a strain which produces abundant and normally maturing perithecia.

Characteristics in culture: Colonies on PSA 15-35 mm diam after 14 d at 20 C. Aerial mycelium floccose, white or honey-colored, becoming dark purple. In some strains, aerial mycelium sparse or absent, colonies slimy. Colony reverse-pigmented dark vinaceous to vinaceous, in some cases unpigmented or with unpigmented sectors. Abundant slimy sporodochia formed on the agar surface and in the aerial mycelium; sporodochia buff, pale violet or dark purple, often forming in concentric rings. In some strains fertile ascocarps developing, especially at the colony margins of mature cultures. On SNA or SNAY hyphal growth diffuse and spreading through the agar, unpigmented, with scattered buff sporodochia forming on the agar surface.

Characteristics in culture: Optimum temperature for growth on PDA and SNA 25-30 ∞C. Colonies grown on PDA with faint concentric rings and poor conidial production after 96 h at 25-30 ∞C. Colonies grown on SNA producing abundant aerial mycelium, sterile after 96 h. Conidia green (27E7-8), without yellow coloration. No pigment diffusing through the agar, no distinctive odour. Conidia forming slowly on PDA, after 72-96 h at 20 ∞C, later at higher temperatures. Colonies grown on CMD at 20 ∞C 
under light filling the Petri plate within 1 wk; conidia forming in scattered pustules in concentric rings; pustules to 1 mm diam, tending to coalesce, dense; conidia also forming well apart from the pustules in the scant aerial mycelium. Conidiophores projecting from the pustules, entirely fertile or sparingly branched along the length, sometimes bearing only one or a few phialides at the tip but otherwise sterile. 
Conidiophores highly intricated within the pustule, a strongly developed main axis not discernable, lateral branches tending to be solitary, paired branches uncommon.

"ascospores of the teleomorph collection have survived 20+ years of laboratory storage conditions. The ex-type isolate E.G.S. 36.1947 has retained more abundant sporulation on PCA than its sibling E.G.S. 36.1949.
Culture at 50X, 5-7d, PCA & V-8: colony 6 cm diam, with 3 pairs of moderately well-defined rings of growth and sporulation. Sporulation on cut agar surface, 2 d: PCA ++, V-8 +++
Sporulation near the PCA agar surface is in closely branching clumps, each with hundreds of conidia, and on crowded stands of short primary conidiophores. The clumps are abundant and crowded near the center of the colony; they are less abundant and less densely branched in successive light-exposed rings of growth of the colony. An open wooly layer of long, ascending, conidiogenous hyphae develops above the entire colony. The sporulation pattern on V-8 is similar, except that the aerial layer is more tightly wooly.
Conidium chains viewed at 50X have a conspicuous appearance of small black beads separated by narrow isthmi. Chains may be simple in young colonies, but to a very great extent they later become variously branched at strong, open angles to the primary chain. The narrow isthmi are secondary conidiophores of various lengths and degree of geniculate extension. Chains have as many as 10-12+ conidia in the primary axis; branching adds an equal or even multiples of this number to the composition of large, open-angled tufts. Chain structure is essentially the same in both surface and aerial sporulation.

Cultures and asexual morph: optimal growth at 25 ∞C on all media, good but considerably variable growth at 30 ∞C, not growing at 35 ∞C. 
On CMD after 72 h colony radius 25-28 mm at 15 ∞C, 42-47 mm at 25 ∞C, 16-35 mm at 30 ∞C; mycelium covering the plate after 5 d at 25 ∞C. Colony hyaline, circular, mycelium dense, of wide primary surface hyphae and narrow secondary hyphae. Aerial hyphae only common and sometimes abundant at the colony margin, causing a downy zone. Autolytic excretions and coilings virtually absent; diffusing pigment lacking; odour indistinct. Chlamydospores uncommon, terminal and intercalary. Conidiation starting after 2-3 d, turning green after 5 d from lateral zone ends, eventually dark green 26-28F4-8; first effuse to shrubby in distant areas of the colony, spreading in 2-4 farinose to floccose concentric zones; shrubs with long, straight, radial, regularly tree-like conidiophores, some growing to pustules; conidia formed in densely disposed minute wet heads; after a week or later conidiation also in pustules 1-2 mm diam, sometimes to 3-5 mm diam.
On PDA after 72 h colony radius 20-21 mm at 15 ∞C, 35-43 mm at 25 ∞C, 17-27 mm at 30 ∞C; mycelium covering the plate after 6 d at 25 ∞C. Colony circular, whitish, farinose to downy; mycelium dense, with conspicuously wide primary surface hyphae. Aerial hyphae abundant, causing a floccose mat. Autolytic excretions and coilings scant; diffusing pigment lacking, reverse dull yellow 4AB3-5; odour indistinct to unpleasant. Conidiation starting after 2 d, turning pale (greenish-)yellow 3B4, 3A3 from the centre after 1 wk or later, effuse and in numerous floccose pustules spreading from the centre and eventually covering more or less the entire plate, with poor conidial yield. At 30 ∞C colony formed in pale irregular zones.
On SNA after 72 h colony radius 18-21 mm at 15 ∞C, 33-39 mm at 25 ∞C, 10-25 mm at 30 ∞C; mycelium covering the plate after 6-7 d at 25 ∞C. Colony similar to CMD, but margin often ill-defined, aerial hyphae reduced, only common at the margin, becoming fertile. Chlamydospores uncommon, sometimes abundant around distant conidiation pustules, mainly intercalary, globose, ellipsoid or oblong, (6.5-)7-10(-10.5) x (4.0-)5.5-9(-10), l/w = (0.9-)1.0-1.5(-2.2) (n=33). Conidiation starting after 3 d, turning green after 4-5 d, eventually 27E3-7, 28E5-8 to 27-28F5-8, first more or less effuse and in loose shrubs with long radial tree-like conidiophores compacting to flat pustules 1-3 mm diam with finely granular to plumose surface; disposed in up to 5 often ill-separated, concentric zones spreading with the growth. Shrubs and pustules consisting of a wide stipe with asymmetric primary branches spanning a loose reticulum with radial, regular tree-like conidiophores of long main axes and side branches emerging from the main axes mostly at right angles, often paired or in verticils, also unpaired, straight or slightly curved, often 1-celled with a single whorl of phialides at upper levels, increasing in length from the top downward; branches 2-5 µm","Trichoderma mediterraneum_522432","Ascospores","2-5","2-5",NA,NA,3.5,3.5
