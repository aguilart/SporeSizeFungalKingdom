# SporeSizeFungalKingdom

You only need one file to reproduce the figures 1, 2, S1, S2 and S3; the apriori contrasts of spore size and sma for spore shape reported in the google docs (as it is by the end of April 2020):

1. SummarySporeTraitAnalysis.RMD 


That RMD file already loads the three datasets used for those figures: 
a. output/Spore_Database_Fungi.csv: Spore size and shape data
b. output/FungalTaxanomy_col.csv: Fungal taxonomy as in the Catalogue of Life
c. output/GuildData.csv: Fungal functional groups.

The three datasets are already uploaded to this repo. Further details on those datasets and the r packages used can be found in "MatchingSpore_FunctionData.R"
