1. How much phylogeny explain variation in spore size?


In my opinion we should be using all the data (~60K entries) and taxonomy as a random factor (only using spore type as fixed effect). **Note this gives different results when I run it compared with the output file Carlos sent.**

```{r, echo=FALSE}

model1<-
lmer(log10(SporeVolume)~SporeType+(1|phylum/class/order/family),data = 
       To_Analysis)

```


```{r}
r2_nakagawa(model1)
```

This result indicates that spore type and taxonmy explain up to 54% of the variation in the total dataset. Spore type explain alone explain very little (7%), indictating that these two variables are highly correlated (particularly at kingdom-wide level).
Thus, the conclusion is is that indeed, taxonomy is a very important “driver” and we should take it into account.

```{r, message=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
# conidia_lifestyle<-
#   lmer(log10(SporeVolume)~simpleFunct+(1|order),data = 
#        Conidia)
# dat <- read_csv('output/df_species_byPrimerSet.csv')
dat <- read_csv('output/df_species_noPrimers.csv')

dat$names_to_use<-gsub("_"," ",dat$Species)

# trial<-left_join(dat %>% 
#                   select(names_to_use,Primers.name,host.assoc, ends_with('mean')), 
#                  To_Analysis[,c("names_to_use","SporeType","simpleFunct","SporeVolume", "Q_ratio",
#                                 "phylum","class","order")])
trial<-left_join(dat %>% 
                  select(names_to_use, host.assoc, log10.sporeVolume, log10.sporeAspectRatio, ends_with('mean'), n_samples_env), 
                 To_Analysis[,c("names_to_use","SporeType","simpleFunct",
                                "phylum","class","order")])

# this is weird that there are species without assignments
trial<-trial[complete.cases(trial),] %>% 
  filter(!order == 'Not assigned')

# table(trial$simpleFunct)
# filter(trial, simpleFunct == 'Human')

# libraries for tables
library(broom)
library(pixiedust)

```

2. So, once taxonomy is taken into account, how important is life-style? Relative to climatic conditions?

For this we subset the data to: a) include only the species for which we have life-style data, and b) we got climatic varialbes. This reduces the original dataset from 60K entries to `r nrow(trial)` entries. **Note that I had to remove some rows in which taxonomy was 'Not assigned', which shouldn't be the case.**

All these outputs confirm the same trend: Taxonomy is important. In fact, using it as fixed factor, shows that is the single most important factor (removing makes the model really bad, adding improves a lot)

Next in “importance” is lifestyle (removing makes the model bad, adding lifestyle makes it better). More so than any other climatic variable or spore type, although the explanatory power of the model is pretty small (< 1\%). **Maybe we should use R2 instead (or in addition to) adjusted R2**
The pattern also holds even when we simplify lifestyles to be either host associated or freeliving fungi. **Not included here**

Spore shape shows a similar pattern with regard to taxonomy being the most important, although spore type ends up being more important and climate and spore type end up being of similar importance. The most important climate variable is solar radiation, with species with more ovoid spores being found in environments with higher solar radiation.


3. How much life-style influence the expected spore size ~ geographic extent?
This is another story :)
